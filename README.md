# Buckaroo Magento2 GraphQL extension
We created a additional GraphQL extension for our [Buckaroo Magento 2 Payments Plugin](https://github.com/buckaroo-it/Magento2).<br>
This was needed for another additional extension that we released, and that is the [HÃ¿va React checkout extension](https://github.com/buckaroo-it/Magento2_Hyva).<br>

<b>What is GraphQL?</b><br>GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.
